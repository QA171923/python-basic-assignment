        "  - Python has a clean and straightforward syntax that closely resembles natural language, making it beginner-friendly.It's instructions look a lot like regular English,so beginners love it.\n",
        "  - It's available on multiple operating systems, like Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
        "  - Python has a vast collection of libraries like NumPy, Pandas etc catering to areas such as data analysis, machine learning,web development etc.\n",
        "  - In python we dont need to declare variable types explicitly.\n",
        "  -There are vast community who use puthon,so it's easy to get help or learn new things.\n",
